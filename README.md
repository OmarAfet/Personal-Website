# Personal Website
Welcome to my personal website repository! This is the first website I have published to showcase my web development skills and projects. I am incredibly happy and proud of this accomplishment. In this repository, you will find the source code for my website, which is built using HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript.

# Motivation
The main motivation behind creating this website was to demonstrate my web development abilities and provide a platform to showcase my projects. I am passionate about web development and plan to create more complex websites in the future. I am also eager to learn about deploying websites and explore frameworks such as React, Flask and Django.

# Features
- **HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript:** The website is built using these technologies to create a visually appealing and interactive user experience.

- **Light/Dark Mode:** One of the challenging aspects of this project was implementing a seamless transition between light and dark modes. I have successfully incorporated this feature, providing users with the option to switch between different modes.

- **About Me:** The website includes an explanation about myself, highlighting my interests, skills, and experiences.

- **Projects:** In the projects section, you will find a collection of my work, websites, useful Python projects, and solved Python challenges. Each project is accompanied by detailed information about its functionalities and implementation.

# Future Plans
I am constantly looking to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in web development. Here are some of my future plans for this project:

- **Complex Websites:** I am excited to work on more complex websites in the future. This will allow me to push the boundaries of my web development skills and explore new technologies and techniques.

- **Learning Deployment:** I am eager to learn about deploying websites to make them accessible to a wider audience. This involves understanding hosting platforms, domain management, and server configurations.

- **Python and Frameworks:** While I prefer using Python over JavaScript, I understand that Python is not typically used for front-end web development. However, I plan to delve deeper into Python-based web frameworks such as Flask and Django to create more dynamic and robust websites. Additionally, I am also interested in expanding my skills to include front-end development using React, to build interactive and responsive user interfaces.

Thank you for visiting my repository! Feel free to explore the code and reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions.
